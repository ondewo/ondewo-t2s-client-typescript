// A STRING FIELD MUST SURVIVE A BINARY ROUND TRIP THROUGH THE GENERATED CODE.
//
// ondewo-proto-compiler 5.15.2 emits `reader.readStringRequireUtf8()` and
// `jspb.internal.public_for_gencode.serializeMapToBinary()`, neither of which exists in google-protobuf
// 3.21.4 -- which this package pinned EXACTLY. Built with that pair, every `deserializeBinary` on a
// message carrying a string throws `TypeError: reader.readStringRequireUtf8 is not a function` (the
// same defect shipped in nlu-client-typescript 7.1.0-7.1.2 and csi-client-typescript 5.5.0-5.5.2).
// The pin is 4.0.2 now.
//
// Nothing else here could see it: the .proto sources, the generated code, the auth suite and its 100%
// coverage gate are all correct -- the generated code and the RUNTIME DEPENDENCY disagree, and only
// decoding a real message exercises that seam.
//
